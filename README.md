Sample implementation to demonstrate how to implement Azure Active Directory authentication in NestJS using custom strategies.

---

## **Description**

This repository contains a sample implementation of `Azure AD` authentication in `NestJS` using custom strategies. The sample implementation is based on the [NestJS official documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication#implementing-passport-strategies) wuth customization to interact and authenticate with Azure Active Directory.

---

## **Installation**

```bash
$ npm install
```
---

## **Configuration**

This application has a .env.example file. Please create a .env file and update the values as per the Azure AD application registration. The below table describes the environment variables used in the application:

| Environment Variable | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `AZURE_AD_TENANTID`  | Azure AD Tenant ID              |
| `AZURE_AD_CLIENTID`  | Azure AD Application Client ID  |
| `AZURE_AD_AUDIENCE`  | Azure AD Token Audience         |

---

## **Running the application**

The application can be run in two modes, `development` and `production`. The `development` mode supports hot reloading which is beneficial during development. The `production` mode is optimized for performance.

The root directory also comtains a `Dockerfile` which can be used to build a docker image of the application for containerization.

### **Development Mode**

Execute the below command to run the application in development mode:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

### **Production Mode**

Execute the below command to run the application in production mode:

```
$ npm run start:prod
```

## **Testing**

The application has tests configured using `Jest`. The tests are located in the `test` directory. The tests are also configured to generate coverage reports. The coverage reports are generated in the `coverage` directory.

### **Unit Tests**

Execute the below command to run the unit tests:

```bash
$ npm run test
```
### **Coverage Reports**

Execute the below command to run the tests and generate the coverage reports:

```bash
$ npm run test:cov
```
